# shared — what every story is built out of

Three stories now, and this is the part they have in common: one warm
vocabulary, one figure engine, two checkers. A new story writes its own
research, prose and drawings, and nothing else.

```
shared/
├── warm.scss        Bootstrap variables — teaches Quarto's chrome the palette
├── warm.css         the page's own look: stops, source blocks, figures, cards
├── ama.csl          numeric superscript citations, numbered by first appearance
├── figure-kit.js    the figure engine — layout, mounting, controls, redraw
└── tools/
    ├── check.js         content audit, every story, no browser
    └── layout-check.js  layout audit, one story, needs a built site + chrome
```

`warm.scss`, `warm.css` and `ama.csl` are wired in at **project level** in
`_quarto.yml`, so a story inherits them by existing. A story's own
`_metadata.yml` carries only what is genuinely its own: its `refs.bib`, and the
script tags for its figures.

The split between the two stylesheets is not cosmetic. Quarto's `cssVarsBlock`
step throws `SCSSParsingError` on quoted strings, negative numbers and `calc()`
inside an `scss:rules` block. It is non-fatal, so it prints on every render and
trains you to ignore render output — which is how a real error gets missed.
**`warm.scss` holds Bootstrap variables only; `warm.css` holds the page's own
rules.**

## Adding a story

```
new-journey/
├── _metadata.yml    bibliography + the script tags (copy an existing one)
├── _figures.html    the four <script> tags, in load order
├── refs.bib         first-citation order, see below
├── index.qmd  …     the pages
└── js/
    ├── figure-data.js   the numbers, with the source of each in a comment
    ├── scenes.js        the drawings
    └── figures.js       what each figure is called and what operates it
```

Then in `_quarto.yml`: add `new-journey/*.qmd` to `render`, add
`new-journey/js/**` to `resources`, and add a sidebar with an `id` listing that
story's pages. Quarto picks the sidebar whose `contents` contain the page being
rendered, which is how three stories share a site without any of them
advertising another's stops. Finally add an `<li>` to the shelf in `index.html`.

`check.js` finds the story on its own — a directory with `.qmd` files and a
`refs.bib` is a story. No configuration to update.

---

## The figure kit

A figure in a `.qmd` is a fenced div holding only its caption:

```markdown
::: {.journey-figure data-scene="resonance"}
The caption, as markdown. It stays in the document, where an editor and
check.js can both see it.
:::
```

and in `js/figures.js`:

```js
Fig.add("resonance", {
  controls: [
    {type:"range", key:"rate", label:"breaths a minute",
     min:3, max:24, step:0.1, fmt:v => `${v.toFixed(1)} a minute`}
  ],
  draw: sceneResonance
});
Fig.start({rate: 14});
```

The kit renders the controls above the drawing, leaves the caption underneath,
wires everything to state and redraws on change.

**Controls are declared, not wired**, and that is the main thing the kit buys.
Two of the error classes in the touch story's handoff come straight from
hand-wiring: a control that was never connected at all — the build passed,
because the file was still valid JavaScript, and only clicking it found the
problem — and a hint that went on saying *tap to take the hand away* after the
hand was already away. Neither mistake is available now: the kit renders the
label from the value.

Four kinds, and adding one here gives it to every story:

| type | what it is | keys it reads |
|---|---|---|
| `pills` | a row of mutually exclusive buttons | `key`, `options[{id,n}]`, `label?` |
| `toggle` | one button that flips, label included | `key`, `on`, `off`, `hint?{on,off}` |
| `range` | a slider with its value beside it | `key`, `min`, `max`, `step`, `fmt?`, `label?`, `aria?` |
| `action` | a button that holds no state | `key`, `n`, `run(state, api)`, `note?` |

A `key` may be a dotted path — `"f.threat"` reads and writes `state.f.threat` —
so a figure with five switches of the same kind keeps them together instead of
scattering five top-level keys through the state. Declaring `controls` as an
array of arrays renders them as two rows, for a figure whose controls are two
different kinds of thing and should not read as one set.

### The drawing helpers

`svgOpen(h, ariaLabel)` · `prose(x,y,w,h,html,opts)` · `track(x0,x1,y,opts)` ·
`fill(x0,x,y,colour,opts)` · `divider(y,text,opts)` · `esc` · `clamp` · `r2`

`svgOpen` asks for an `aria-label`, which is the cheapest way to make sure none
gets forgotten. `prose` is a `foreignObject`, because it is the only way to get
real line breaking inside an SVG.

### Two layouts

Scenes are drawn against `W`: **860 wide, 420 narrow**, and every scene must
branch on `NARROW`. Without a narrow branch a scene is drawn for an 860 canvas
inside a 420 one and most of it lands off-screen.

The choice is made from **the figure's own box width**, not the viewport. With
a sidebar and a margin table of contents the viewport stops predicting the
drawing box — at an 1100px window the reading column is about 560px, and an
860-unit scene puts its labels at 8.8px there. A `ResizeObserver` re-renders
when the decision flips, and only then.

## The two checkers

```bash
node shared/tools/check.js                    # every story
node shared/tools/check.js pain-journey       # one
quarto render                                 # layout-check reads the BUILD
node shared/tools/layout-check.js pain-journey
node shared/tools/layout-check.js pain-journey 390 1400 --page how-loose
```

**check.js** reads source. Every citation resolves to a `refs.bib` entry; every
stop has its year, lead, source block and figure; the source block sits *above*
the figure, because a reader should not meet a claim before they meet its
source; every figure names a scene that is registered; stated counts match
reality; a `WEIGHTS` or `CLAIMS` array is still in descending order and its
weakest entry has not drifted upward; and a list of phrasings that have caused
trouble before does not appear.

**layout-check.js** renders the built pages in headless Chrome at six widths,
operates every control the kit can make — plus anything inside a drawing
carrying `data-fig-click` — and asserts that nothing leaves its viewBox and no
two labels overlap. Geometry comes from `getBBox()`, so results are independent
of display scale. It skips quietly with no chrome on PATH.

Its tolerance is **±0.6 user units**, tighter than the ±2 the touch story's own
checker used. That is not pedantry: text width in *user units* grows as the
drawing box shrinks — a CSS-pixel font divided by the scale factor — so a
right-anchored label in a fixed gutter can overrun the edge only at small
widths. One had been doing so by about a pixel for the life of the narrow
layout, and ±2 was exactly wide enough to hide it.

**What layout-check cannot catch, and you have to look for yourself: an opaque
shape drawn over a label.** The overlap test compares `<text>` with `<text>`; a
`<path>` or a `<foreignObject>` covering one is invisible to it. That has now
happened three times in this repository — a doorway painting over a condition
label, a note block landing on two markers, and a curve drawn through its own
axis label. **After moving anything in a scene, screenshot it.**

A related habit worth keeping: derive a canvas height from where the content
actually ends rather than typing a number. Every height bug so far has been a
guessed constant.

---

## refs.bib, and the order it is in

Entries are in **first-citation order across the pages**, not alphabetical,
because the AMA style numbers by order of appearance and each story's
`carry-back.qmd` pulls the whole file in with `nocite: @*`. That makes the
closing list read as a record of the route. A new entry goes in under the
section comment for the page that first cites it, at the point that page
reaches it — not appended at the end.

**Do not add an entry before its prose lands.** Because of the `nocite` pull it
would appear in the closing list uncited, and `check.js` only notes that rather
than failing.

House style: `@article{nameYY,`, given names as initials, diacritics in author
names as LaTeX escapes (`{\AA}`, `{\"o}`) while titles keep the published
characters as they stand, journal names spelled out in full, `--` page ranges,
and titles in double braces so citeproc reproduces them exactly. A published
title is a quoted record and is never reworded.

---

## docs/ is output only

`docs/` is what GitHub Pages serves and it is Quarto's `output-dir`. Quarto
**deletes anything in there that the project does not know about** — it removed
a published story once and replaced the hand-written shelf with a redirect
stub. Anything that has to exist there must be a project input: rendered from a
`.qmd`, or listed under `resources`. Never hand-edit `docs/`.

---

## The render workflow

Everything runs from the **repository root**.

```bash
# 1. build the whole site — all three stories plus the shelf
quarto render

# 2. content audit — every story, no browser, milliseconds
node shared/tools/check.js

# 3. layout audit — reads the BUILD, so it goes after the render
node shared/tools/layout-check.js touch-journey
node shared/tools/layout-check.js pain-journey
node shared/tools/layout-check.js breath-journey
```

Every story uses the same two tools; the touch story had its own until it was
migrated onto the kit (2026-09-07), and there is no exception left.

**Read the `clicks` column.** It is how many controls the checker actually
operated, and a zero there on a story with figures means it is auditing them
at rest and telling you nothing about any other state. It refuses rather than
reporting "clean" in that case — that failure is exactly how the touch
migration started.

While drafting, the useful loop is narrower:

```bash
quarto render                                                   # or scope it:
quarto render breath-journey                                    # one story
node shared/tools/check.js breath-journey
node shared/tools/layout-check.js breath-journey 390 1400        # two widths
node shared/tools/layout-check.js breath-journey --page why-slow # one page
```

`check.js` reads source and needs no render. `layout-check.js` reads
`docs/`, so **render first or it audits a stale build** — that has caught
people out.

And the step neither tool can do: **screenshot the figure you changed.** The
layout checker compares `<text>` with `<text>`, so an opaque shape drawn over a
label is invisible to it. Three such bugs have shipped past a green checker in
this repository.

```bash
google-chrome --headless --disable-gpu --no-sandbox \
  --allow-file-access-from-files --window-size=1400,7000 \
  --virtual-time-budget=6000 --screenshot=/tmp/page.png \
  "file://$PWD/docs/breath-journey/why-slow.html"
```
